# get-coordinates and get-weather
## get_coord.py  
This program can be use to get the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of a location from anywhere in the globe. Just enter the location you want to test upon running the code, and it'll print out the results.  

## get_weather.py  
This program can be use to get current weather information all around the world. Weather information include: current temperature in celcius, feels like in celcius, current day-night cycle, current condition, and some general information about the place entered. To use, the process is generally the same as with get_coord.py with the major difference being you'll need to provide your own API keys for both (GeocodingAPI & WeatherAPI) to proceed with the accessing of the weather information.

## How to use  
To use the programs, simply run the files. A prompt will appear and then just enter your api and interact with it as you like lol.  

## NOTES  
### API KEYS  
These two uses APIs to do their tasks, thus you must be able to provide your own API keys to use the two. Get your APIs via [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).  

### You NEED get_coord.py to run get_weather.py  
To use get_weather properly, both files must be in the same directory. Thus it is imperative that you download and put both files in the same folder. This is the result of my incompetence. You must forgive me for this. My apologies...
