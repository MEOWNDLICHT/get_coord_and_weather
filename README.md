# API PROJECTS: get_coords.py & get_weather.py


## get_coords.py  
This program can be use to get the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of a location from anywhere in the globe. Just enter the location you want to test upon running the code, and it'll print out the results.  

## get_weather.py  
This program can be use to get current weather information all around the world.  

## NOTES  
### API KEYS  
These two uses APIs to do their tasks, thus you must be able to provide your own API keys to use the two. For get_coords.py, get your own GeocodingAPI from OpenWeatherMap; as for get_weather.py, get your own API via WeatherAPI (OpenWeatherMap).   

### You NEED get_coords.py to use get_weather.py  
To use get_weather properly, both files must be in the same directory. Thus it is imperative that you download and put both files in the same folder.
